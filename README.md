# Video-Steganography
Video Steganography Tool User Guide. This python script allows user to hide secret text file on media files such as image, audio, and video.

The purpose of this repository is to explore both the relationships between discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients as well as the variation in DCT coefficients across popular video codecs with a focus on improving and optimizing DCT-based steganographic systems. The primary focus of this repository is on variation histograms and correlation heatmaps (explained below).

#### 1.Run file Encoding.py: 
- Enter Video Name To Encryption : test.mp4
- Enter Message Secret To Hidden: thisismessage
- -->Result: File final.mp4 is saved in folder video

#### 2. Run file Decoding.py: 
- Enter Video name to Decryption: final.mp4
- --> Result: Message Secret & Length
